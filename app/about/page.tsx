      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I`&apos;`m Zaq Reynolds, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack
        Web Developer with a history of making pixel-perfect web applications
        for a variety of uses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With a career spanning over five years in the tech industry, I have
        developed a robust skill set in building and optimizing web applications
        that deliver a seamless user experience.
      </p>

        From my early days as a Senior Audio Engineer at Sound Emporium in
        Nashville, where I honed my attention to detail and creative
        problem-solving skills, to my current role at Utopia Solutions in Los
        Angeles, my journey has been fueled by a relentless pursuit of
        excellence and a deep love for technology. My technical expertise
        includes a wide array of development languages and frameworks such as
        Node.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, Express.js, Next.js, Tailwind,
        Bootstrap, and MySQL, among others. I take pride in my ability to
        translate complex technical challenges into intuitive and visually
        appealing web solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In my role at Utopia Solutions, I`&apos;`ve had the privilege of working
        on cutting-edge web and mobile applications, where I collaborated
        closely with product teams and engineers to develop, test, launch, and
        support projects that push the boundaries of what`&apos;`s possible on
        the web. My tenure at MetaTech.dev as a Front End Developer Intern
        further solidified my skills in software development, particularly in
        fintech applications, where I contributed to all aspects of the
        development process, from design to deployment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Prior to my tech career, I earned a B.A. in Music Production &
        Engineering from Berklee College of Music and a B.S. in Marketing from
        Arizona State University. This unique combination of creative and
        technical education has equipped me with a versatile skill set that I
        leverage in every project I undertake.

        Outside of work, I`&apos;`m an avid golfer who recently broke 90, a
        Sunday morning tennis player, and a once-aspiring bakery CEO. These
        interests, while seemingly unrelated to my profession, have taught me
        the importance of persistence, strategy, and the joy of pursuing
        one`&apos;`s passions. Whether I`&apos;`m coding, collaborating with
        clients, or hitting a backhand on the tennis court, I bring energy,
        enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence to everything I do.
        I`&apos;`m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow
        both personally and professionally. Let`&apos;`s connect and explore how
        we can create something amazing together.
